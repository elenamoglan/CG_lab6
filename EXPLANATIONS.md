# Explanations:

## Exercise 2: 
To ensure that the **Voronoi diagram** associated with the set of points ${A_1, A_2, ..., A_8}$ has exactly 4 edges of the type half-line, we need to carefully position $A_7$ and $A_8$ so that four regions extend to infinity, creating exactly 4 half-line edges.

### Key Observations
1. A **Voronoi edge of type half-line** occurs at the boundary of the convex hull of the points, where there is no neighboring point to terminate the edge.
2. For the Voronoi diagram to have exactly 4 such edges, the **convex hull** of the point set must include exactly 4 points.

### Construction
We already have the points:
- $A_1 = (5, -1), A_2 = (7, -1), A_3 = (9, -1), A_4 = (7, -3), A_5 = (11, -1), A_6 = (-9, 3).$

These points span a roughly linear or narrow arrangement. To achieve 4 edges of the type half-line, we position $A_7$ and $A_8$ as follows:
1. $A_7 = (-10, -5)$: Placed far to the bottom-left to form part of the convex hull.
2. $A_8 = (13, 5)$: Placed far to the top-right to form another part of the convex hull.

### Explanation
- With $A_7 = (-10, -5)$ and $A_8 = (13, 5)$, the convex hull now includes exactly 4 points: $A_7, A_6, A_8$, and $A_5$.
- The other points $(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4)$ lie inside the convex hull, so their Voronoi regions are fully bounded.
- The 4 convex hull points each generate a Voronoi edge that extends to infinity, creating exactly 4 half-line edges.

### Visualization
The plot created in Matlab illustrates the **Voronoi diagram** for the points ${A_1, A_2, ..., A_8}$. Here's what you can observe:
1. **Convex Hull**:
   - The convex hull includes exactly four points: $A_7, A_6, A_8, A_5$, highlighted by green edges.
2. **Half-Line Edges**:
   - Each convex hull vertex generates a Voronoi region that extends to infinity, resulting in exactly 4 edges of the type half-line.
3. **Interior Points**:
   - The other points $(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4)$ have fully bounded Voronoi regions because they are inside the convex hull.
This construction satisfies the condition of having exactly 4 half-line edges.

### Explanation of Code
1. *Points Definition*: Original points $A_1$ to $A_6$ are defined in original_points. Additional points $A_7$ and $A_8$ are added in new_points.
2. *Voronoi Diagram*: $voronoi(x, y)$ computes the Voronoi diagram and returns the edge coordinates.
3. *Convex Hull*: $convhull(x, y)$ identifies the boundary points of the convex hull. These points are plotted to verify the convex hull contains exactly 4 points.
### Visualization:
- The Voronoi edges are blue.
- The convex hull edges are green.
- Points are red circles, labeled for clarity.

## Exercise 3: 
To determine the value of the parameter $\lambda$ that minimizes the length of the minimal spanning tree (MST) associated with the given set of points, including $Q = (2 - \lambda, 3)$, we proceed as follows:

### **Approach**
1. **Understand the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST):**
   - An MST is a subset of edges from a weighted graph that connects all vertices with the smallest possible total edge weight.
   - Here, the graph is a complete graph where the vertices are the points $A, B, C, D, E, F, P, Q$, and the edge weights are the Euclidean distances between these points.

2. **Impact of $\lambda$:**
   - The position of $Q = (2 - \lambda, 3)$ depends on $\lambda$, so its distances to other points will vary.
   - The MST length will change as the distances between $Q$ and the other points.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - To minimize the MST length, $Q$ should be positioned such that it minimizes its distance to the most critical nearby points (likely $P = (-2, 3)$, and possibly others).

4. **Procedure:**
   - Compute the Euclidean distance between $Q$ and the nearby points as a function of $\lambda$.
   - Determine the value of $\lambda$ that minimizes the total MST length.

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Distances Involving Q:**
   - Let $Q = (2 - \lambda, 3)$.
   - Compute the distances:
     - d(Q, P) = $\sqrt{((-2) - (2 - \lambda))^2 + (3 - 3)^2}$ = $\sqrt{(4 - \lambda)^2} = |4 - \lambda|$.
     - d(Q, F) = $\sqrt{((-5) - (2 - \lambda))^2 + (3 - 3)^2}$ = $\sqrt{(-7 + \lambda)^2} = |7 - \lambda\)$.
     - Similarly, compute $d(Q, A)$, $d(Q, B)$, $d(Q, C)$, $d(Q, D)$, and $d(Q, E)$.

2. **Simplifying Assumptions:**
   - Since the MST uses the shortest edges to connect all points, focus on the nearest neighbors of $Q$ (likely $P$ and $F$).
   - Minimize the sum $d(Q, P) + d(Q, F)$, as these two edges are likely to contribute significantly to the MST.

3. **Optimize $\lambda$:**
   - Combine the expressions:
     $d(Q, P) + d(Q, F) = |4 - \lambda| + |7 - \lambda|.$
   - This piecewise-linear function has critical points where $\lambda$ transitions between different linear segments, i.e., at $\lambda = 4$ and $\lambda = 7$.
   - Analyze the function:
     - If $\lambda \leq 4$: $d(Q, P) + d(Q, F) = (4 - \lambda) + (7 - \lambda) = 11 - 2\lambda$.
     - If $4 < \lambda \leq 7$: $d(Q, P) + d(Q, F) = (\lambda - 4) + (7 - \lambda) = 3$.
     - If $\lambda > 7$: $d(Q, P) + d(Q, F) = (\lambda - 4) + (\lambda - 7) = 2\lambda - 11$.

4. **Minimizing the Function:**
   - For $\lambda \leq 4, 11 - 2\lambda$ decreases as $\lambda$ increases.
   - For $4 < \lambda \leq 7$, the function is constant $(3).
   - For $\lambda > 7, 2\lambda - 11$ increases as $\lambda$ increases.
   - Therefore, the minimum occurs in the range $4 < \lambda \leq 7$, where the function equals $3$.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The MST length is minimized for any $\lambda$ in the range $4 < \lambda \leq 7$, with the smallest MST length being constant at $3$.

### **Explanation of the Construction**
The value of $\lambda$ directly affects the position of $Q$ and hence its distances to nearby points. By strategically positioning $Q$ within the interval $4 < \lambda \leq 7$, we ensure that $Q$ balances its distances to $P$ and $F$, leading to the smallest contribution to the MST.

### Explanation of Code
1. **Optimization**:
The code evaluates the MST length for various $\lambda$ values using Prim's algorithm. It identifies the $\lambda$ value that minimizes the MST length.
2. **MST Calculation**:
Computes the Euclidean distances between all pairs of points, including $Q$, and constructs a complete graph. Finds the MST using MATLAB's minspantree function.
3. **Visualization**:
    - Plots the points and the MST edges.
    - Labels the points for clarity.
    - Displays the optimal $\lambda$ in the title.
